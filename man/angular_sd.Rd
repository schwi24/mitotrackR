\title{Standard deviation of angle}
\usage{
angular_sd(x, units = "radians")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{units}{A character string declaring the units of the angles. The
default is \code{'radians'} but can also be \code{'degree'}.}
}
\value{
The average angle in radians or degrees.
